# MTG Stories

This is an archive of MTG stories publicly available on Wizard of the Coast website and compiled into PDF version. Images are also available either in PDF or as a separate files.

Stories are sorted into folder `stories` by set name and in published order.

Stories from Magic 2013 to Modern Masters 2015 are sorted with https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Story.  
Stories from Magic Origins to March of the Machine: The Aftermath are sorted with https://mtglore.com/story-timeline-published-order/.  
Stories from Wilds of Eldraine going forward sorted with https://mtgstory.com

To download and compile I wrote a small Python script, which is not part this repository.

If you want to download all the PDFs or complete stories in one big file (with or without images), use https://github.com/polarkac/MTG-Stories/releases  
If you want to compile all stories into one big PDF yourself, use Typst source file `COMPLETE_STORIES.typ`.

# Typst

I used [Typst](https://typst.app/) as typesetting system (modern version of LaTeX). Every story has source file `.typ` which can be used to compile your own PDF.

You can use web app - though I do not know how to work with own packages in web app - or better to use CLI version of Typst which you can download from https://github.com/typst/typst

Folder `typst_packages` has a small package `mtgstory` under `local` namespace which is used as base setting for all the stories. If you want to use it, you have to put it in your Typst package directory:

Windows: `%APPDATA/typst/packages/`  
Linux: `~/.local/share/typst/packages/`

More info can be found https://github.com/typst/packages#local-packages
