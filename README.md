# MTG Stories

This is an archive of MTG stories publicly available on Wizard of the Coast website and compiled into PDF version. Images are also available either in PDF or as a separate files.

Stories are sorted into folder `stories` by set name and in published order.

Stories from Magic 2013 to Modern Masters 2015 are sorted with https://mtg.wiki/page/Magic_Story.  
Stories from Magic Origins to March of the Machine: The Aftermath are sorted with https://mtglore.com/chronological/.  
Stories from Wilds of Eldraine going forward sorted with https://mtgstory.com

To download and compile I wrote a small Python script, which is not part this repository.

If you want to download all the PDFs or complete stories in one big file (with or without images), use https://github.com/polarkac/MTG-Stories/releases  
If you want to compile all stories into one big PDF yourself, use Typst source file `COMPLETE_STORIES.typ`.

# Typst

I used [Typst](https://typst.app/) as typesetting system (modern version of LaTeX). Every story has source file `.typ` which can be used to compile your own PDF.

## Compiling

First you must move the directories inside `typst_packages` into package directory based on OS. If the directory does not exist, create it.

Windows: `%APPDATA/typst/packages/`  
Linux: `~/.local/share/typst/packages/`  
MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/typst/packages/`

Download latest release of Typst https://github.com/typst/typst/releases for your OS. It is command line tool, so you will have to have some knowledge to use it. Also you might want to add Typst executable to your system PATH variable.

After all that you can use `typst` command to compile the source file into PDF. Switch to a directory where `stories` directory is.

`cd /home/polarkac/mtgstory`

And to compile:

`typst compile "stories/042 - Strixhaven: School of Mages/001_Episode 1: Class Is in Session.typ"`

This will create compiled PDF beside the Typst source file with a same name.
